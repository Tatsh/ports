long_description    MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that \
                    you own into free and patents-unencumbered format that \
                    can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format converter, \
                    otherwise called transcoder. It converts the video \
                    clips from proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into \
                    a set of MKV files, preserving most information but not \
                    changing it in any way. The MKV format can store multiple \
                    video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve \
                    chapters. There are many players that can play MKV files \
                    nearly on all platforms, and there are tools to convert \
                    MKV files to many formats, including DVD and Blu-ray discs.
